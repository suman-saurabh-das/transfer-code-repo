  [01] What is a data structure ?

  ▣ A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
  ▣ A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data.

  [02] Why learn data structures ?

  ▣ Every application we build involves data modelled in a certain way. To efficiently manage that data we need data structures.
  ▣ The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure.
  ▣ Data structures help us to solve problems in a more efficient way both in terms of time and memory.
  ▣ Data structures also provide a profound understanding of things like - DOM (tree), Browser back and forward (stack), OS job scheduling (queue).

  ▣ Built-in data structures - arrays, objects, sets & maps.
  ▣ Custom data structures - stacks, queues, circular queues, linked lists, hash tables, trees, graphs.
